#  Financial Models Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **financial modeling tools, valuation scripts, and statistical analysis implementations** built using Python (and some R/Excel datasets).

The goal of this project is to:

* Implement core financial valuation models
* Perform statistical regression analysis for financial datasets
* Build reusable finance utilities and calculators
* Support learning and experimentation in quantitative finance and financial analytics

Financial models help evaluate company performance, valuation, and financial health by combining financial ratios, statements, and forecasts.
